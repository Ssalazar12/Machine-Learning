A neural network is used to classify the phases of the Square-lattice Ising Model.

The network consists of a densely connected network with one hidden layer and two output neurons, corresponding
to high and low temperature phases. 

The inpiut data consits of spin configurations generated by the montecarlo simulation found in:

The weight matrices for the layers are analysed in order to idenitify which physical features, if any, the NN learns
in order to classify the data.
